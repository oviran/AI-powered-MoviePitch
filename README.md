# 🎬 AI powered MoviePitch Web App

This repository contains the source code for a AI powered MoviePitch web application built using chatGPT, Dall-E, GPT-3.5 Turbo & JavaScript. 

MoviePitch is an AI-powered application that transforms a simple one-sentence idea into a full-fledged movie concept complete with a synopsis, title, cast, and cover art. This project leverages the capabilities of the OpenAI API, integrating both ChatGPT for text generation and DALL-E for image creation.

In this project, we explore the capabilities of the OpenAI API, utilizing advanced models such as gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct and DALL-E. The application employs various approaches, including the Zero-Shot and Few-Shot techniques, to enhance the quality and diversity of the generated content.
